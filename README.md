## Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Modern Material-UI interface with WNBA team selection
- Real-time roster building requests with strategy selection
- Multi-select priorities (leadership, scoring, defense, chemistry)
- Error handling and loading states

### Backend (FastAPI + LangGraph)
- **Parallel LangGraph Workflow**: 
  - Player Analysis Node: Performance evaluation and roster composition
  - Salary Cap Node: CBA compliance and contract recommendations
  - Team Chemistry Node: Leadership dynamics and compatibility analysis
  - Roster Construction Node: Combines all data into comprehensive team building plan
- **Groq LLM**: Fast inference with basketball domain expertise
- **Comprehensive Tracing**: LangChain + LiteLLM instrumentation

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```bash
# Required: Groq API Key (get from https://console.groq.com)
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

# Required: Arize observability (get from https://app.arize.com)
ARIZE_SPACE_ID=your_arize_space_id
ARIZE_API_KEY=your_arize_api_key

# Optional: For real-time WNBA data and stats
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key

# Optional: Fallback to OpenAI if Groq unavailable
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# LiteLLM Configuration
LITELLM_LOG=DEBUG
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend  
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
# Start both services
./start.sh

# Or run separately:
# Backend: cd backend && python main.py
# Frontend: cd frontend && npm start
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
