# WNBA Team Builder - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The WNBA Team Builder is an AI-powered application that helps general managers, coaches, analysts, and fans build optimal WNBA rosters within Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) constraints. By repurposing our existing AI trip planner infrastructure, we will create a sophisticated team building tool that leverages parallel LangGraph processing, Groq's fast inference, and comprehensive observability.

**Project Goals:**
- Transform existing trip planning architecture into a WNBA team building platform
- Provide intelligent roster construction within CBA salary cap constraints
- Enable draft simulation, free agency planning, and trade analysis
- Create an intuitive interface for exploring team building scenarios

## Product Overview

### Problem Statement
WNBA general managers face complex challenges in building competitive teams within strict CBA constraints:
- Hard salary cap of $1,507,100 (2025) with minimal exceptions
- Complex free agency rules (restricted, unrestricted, cored, reserved)
- Roster requirements (11-12 players)
- Draft implications and rookie contract structures
- Prioritization rules affecting veteran availability

### Solution
A comprehensive AI-powered team building platform that:
- Validates all roster moves against current CBA rules
- Provides intelligent suggestions for roster optimization
- Simulates draft scenarios and trade possibilities
- Analyzes cap space utilization and contract strategy
- Offers real-time constraint checking and scenario planning

### Target Users
