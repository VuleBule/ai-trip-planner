      "result": "**Dallas Wings 2025 Roster Construction Plan**\n\n**Priority Signings/Trades:**\n1. **Restructure Contracts:** Target restructuring for mid-tier players to free up cap space. Consider trading a high-salary player (e.g., a veteran with a $200k+ salary) for a younger, cost-effective option.\n2. **Free Agency:** Pursue a versatile forward (e.g., a player like Azura Stevens) to complement Ogunbowale and Sabally. Allocate $300k for this signing.\n\n**Contract Structures:**\n- Offer 1-2 year deals to free agents to maintain flexibility.\n- Utilize minimum contracts for bench players to meet roster requirements.\n\n**Roster Composition:**\n- Maintain core: Ogunbowale, Sabally, and a new forward.\n- Add 2-3 young players (rookies or low-cost veterans) to develop alongside the core.\n- Ensure 11-12 players on the roster, balancing experience and youth.\n\n**Timeline for Moves:**\n- **Pre-Draft:** Execute trades and signings to finalize roster before the draft.\n- **Post-Draft:** Assess draft picks and adjust roster accordingly.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- High risk in trading key players; ensure replacements can maintain competitiveness.\n- Monitor team chemistry closely post-moves to avoid disruption.",
